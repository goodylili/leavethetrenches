## Product Name: **Leave the Trenches** (Working Title)

**Tagline:** The Opportunities Engine for Africans

---

# 1. Overview

Leave the Trenches is an opportunities aggregator built specifically for Africans seeking global access — scholarships, immigration pathways, jobs abroad, fellowships, startup visas, and funding programs.

The platform centralizes verified international opportunities and provides structured guidance, eligibility matching, and deadline tracking.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

Africans seeking opportunities abroad face:

* Scattered information across multiple websites
* Outdated or misleading immigration content
* Scholarship scams
* No centralized filtering by nationality
* Complex eligibility requirements
* Poor deadline tracking
* No clarity on chances of acceptance

Users rely on Twitter threads, Telegram groups, random blogs, and agents.

There is no trusted, Africa-first aggregation platform.

If you want to study, work, migrate, or build abroad — you start here.
